            <h4>Church Background</h4>
            <p>Located in Rydalmere (Sunday worship) and Telopea (church office) NSW, Grace Community Chapel Sydney was planted in late 2020.</p>
            <p>After visiting from America several times over the years, God made clear the need for more disciple-making churches that were gospel centered, Spirit-filled, and theologically sound. Pastor Paul and his family took up this call in faith with a team of brothers and sisters that was sold on the vision to make disciples of Jesus Christ all throughout Sydney, Australia, and beyond.</p>
            <p>Although a new church plant still in itsâ€™ infancy, with limited resources, GCC is offering this internship as Pastor Paul is convicted to mentor, develop, and give opportunities to younger pastors in the Sydney area to learn more about ministry and learn what it takes to make disciples of Jesus Christ in the church ministry context.</p>
            <p>Refer to our church website to learn more about our story, leadership, and beliefs.</p>

              <li>Work intimately with Pastor Paul who has a heart to mentor and work with younger pastors.</li>
